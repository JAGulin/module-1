In the second day of module-1, we mainly talk about MLlib, the Spark Machine Learning (ML) module. Moreover, we present regression and classification as the fundamental of ML, and show to implement them using MLlib. Finally, we discuss about the graph processing component in Spark, called GraphX, and show to process graphs using 
it.
